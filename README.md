## 2. VascoCyber

This script allows the user to choose from a variety of cybersecurity tools and run them with customizable options. The selected tool is executed through the subprocess module, and the output is returned to the user.

### Usage

You run the script and select the category of the tool you want to use (network scanning, DNS reconnaissance, information gathering, or exploitation). You then choose the specific tool and the options or targets you want for the tool. The script will execute the tool with the chosen options and return the output.

### Tools Covered

The script currently covers the following tools:

- **Network Scanning:** Nmap
- **DNS Reconnaissance:** Whois, Fierce, Dnsenum

These tools are not included in the script itself. They need to be separately installed in the system where the script is running.
